## Important Points
- Some of these commands can be harmful and should be used only on a 'needs-must' basis.
  - `rm -r <directory>` - This command will delete the directory and all of it's contents without any warning!
  - `sudo su` - This command will log in as the Super User (root)!
  - `sudo apt update -y` - The `-y` here means "Just do it!"
  - `sudo apt upgrade -y` - This command can potentially break the programme!!
  - `kill <PID>` - kill process without warning or confirmation
  - `Kill -9 <PID>` - Brute force kill, This will kill the process but not the parent.
    - This command could lead to 'Zombie Processes' which could consume resources.
    - Use only as a very last resort.
