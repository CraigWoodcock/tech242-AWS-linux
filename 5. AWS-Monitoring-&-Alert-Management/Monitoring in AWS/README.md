## What is AWS Monitoring

- Reacting - Reacting to an issue without first thinking about
- Responding

Monitoring is a way for us to be able to monitor metrics of our services and applications to ensure that the system doesn't 'fall over' or fail.

## How Can we Monitor Our Applications on AWS?
We can monitor our applications or services on AWS using an Alert Management System called Cloud Watch. We can create a dashboard specific to each VM and enable detailed monitoring to visually see the load on our systems and take steps to respond to issues.

We can also configure Cloud Watch alerts to notify us when metrics hit a specific point so that we can respond accordingly.
